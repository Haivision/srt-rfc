	 <t>   This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC
   provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured
   communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path
   migration.  QUIC includes security measures that ensure
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment
   circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration of
   TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion
   control algorithm.
