Abstract

   This document presents an approach to tunnelling SRT live streams
   over QUIC datagrams.

   QUIC [RFC9000] is a UDP-based transport protocol providing TLS
   encryption, stream multiplexing, and connection migration.  It was
   designed to become a faster alternative to the TCP protocol
   [RFC7323].

   An Unreliable Datagram Extension to QUIC [QUIC-DATAGRAM] adds support
   for sending and receiving unreliable datagrams over a QUIC
   connection, but transfers the responsibility for multiplexing
   different kinds of datagrams, or flows of datagrams, to an
   application protocol.

   SRT [SRTRFC] is a UDP-based transport protocol.  Essentially, it can
   operate over any unreliable datagram transport.  SRT provides loss
   recovery and stream multiplexing mechanisms.  In its live streaming
   configuration SRT provides an end-to-end latency-aware mechanism for
   packet loss recovery.  If SRT fails to recover a packet loss within a
   specified latency, then the packet is dropped to avoid blocking
   playback of further packets.

   The Datagram Extension to QUIC could be used as an underlying
   transport instead of UDP.  This way QUIC would provide TLS-level
   security, connection migration, and potentially multi-path support.
   It would be easier for existing network facilities to process, route,
   and load balance the unified QUIC traffic.  SRT on its side would
   provide end-to-end latency tracking and latency-aware loss recovery.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  SRT for Low Latency

   The Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) protocol [SRTRFC] is a
   connection-based transport protocol that enables the secure, reliable
   transport of data across unpredictable networks, such as the
   Internet.  While any data type can be transferred via SRT, it is
   ideal for low latency (sub-second) video streaming.  SRT enables high
   contribution bitrates over long distance connections.

   To achieve low latency streaming, SRT addresses timing issues.  The
   characteristics of a stream from a source network can be notably
   changed by transmission over the public Internet, introducing delays,
   jitter, and packet loss.  This, in turn, leads to problems with
   decoding, as audio and video decoders do not receive packets at the
   expected pace.  The use of large buffers helps, but latency is
   increased.  SRT includes a mechanism to keep a constant end-to-end
   latency, thus recreating the signal characteristics on the receiver
   side, and reducing the need for buffering.

   SRT employs a listener (server) / caller (client) model.  The data
   flow is bi-directional and independent of the connection initiation -
   either the sender or receiver can operate as listener or caller to
   initiate a connection.

   The SRT protocol provides an internal multiplexing mechanism,
   allowing multiple SRT connections to share the same UDP port,
   providing access control functionality to identify the caller on the
   listener side.  This mechanism is exactly what QUIC DATAGRAM
   describes as a responsibility of the application protocol.

   Supporting forward error correction (FEC) and selective packet
   retransmission (ARQ), SRT provides the flexibility to use either of
   the two mechanisms or both combined, allowing for use cases ranging
   from the lowest possible latency to the highest possible reliability.

   SRT also allows fast file transfers, and adds support for AES
   encryption.

1.2.  QUIC for Universal Transport

   The QUIC transport protocol [RFC9000] is a connection-based transport
   protocol built on top of UDP.  It provides a workflow similar to that
   of TCP, but for modern fast networks.

   TODO: Add more details to the current section.  Write about lower
   connection times, faster delivery, ARQ, CC, etc.

3.  Use Cases for SRT over QUIC

   SRT itself is very close to QUIC, and provides similar transport
   mechanisms.  However, the main focus of SRT is on low-latency live
   contribution and distribution.  SRT is widely used by various
   broadcasters to enable low-latency streaming of live events.  It is
   also used in various mobile and IoT devices to get low-latency
   feedback and live feeds.

   QUIC is supported by CDN companies.  Many facilities know how to
   handle and route QUIC traffic.  QUIC provides certain security
   advantages (TLS, encrypting headers so that traffic is not
   distinguishable).

   SRT tunnelled over QUIC allows managing live delivery mechanisms
   (preserving end-to-end latency and dropping "too late" data).

4.  Tunnelling SRT over QUIC

   The QUIC DATAGRAM frame is structured as follows:

   Packet Contents.  Packet Contents as per packet type.

4.1.  Overhead

   An SRT data packet has a 16-byte header, which adds to the payload of
   a QUIC packet.

   For example, let us consider a payload size of 1128 bytes (six
   188-byte MPEG-TS packets).  For a 20 Mbps stream, knowing that each
   data packet gets an additional 16 bytes of overhead, SRT would
   provide an overhead of only ~280 kbits/s (or 1.4%).

   Increasing the size of the payload, e.g., to 1316 bytes (seven
   188-byte MPEG-TS packets), SRT overhead at 20 Mbps would be ~240
   kbits/s (or 1.2%).

   An SRT receiver also sends a full ACK packet every 10 ms.  The size
   of the ACK packet is 44 bytes.  This traffic goes in the opposite
   direction: from the payload receiver to the payload sender.  The
   payload sender responds to every ACK packet with a corresponding
   16-byte ACKACK packet.  This gives an additional 1600 bytes per
   second, which may be considered negligible.

4.2.  Packet Integrity

   SRT does not provide mechanisms to verify the integrity of packets,
   nor to distinguish a packet from a continuous data stream.  SRT
   assumes that the underlying transport protocol delivers a single and
   undamaged packet to SRT.  Therefore, the underlying transport MUST
   provide a mechanism for SRT to send and receive exactly one packet.

   One SRT packet MUST be sent over exactly one QUIC Datagram frame.

4.3.  Connection Establishment

   QUIC has a fast and secure crypto handshake based on TLS.  A client
   connects to a server, and it can verify the server based on its
   certificate.  A new client connection takes two times the RTT to be
   established.  If a client connects to a known server, then it can try
   to establish a faster 0-RTT connection.

   Once a QUIC connection is established, QUIC datagrams can be sent in
   both directions.  SRT can use this QUIC datagram tunnelling to
   establish one or many connections on its own.  Each SRT connection
   would take two times the RTT for handshaking.

   The first handshake round of SRT is intended to get an initial
   response from the server, identifying handshake procedure version and
   getting a cookie from the server (listener) to mitigate potential DoS
   attacks.  Apart from that, no viable data is exchanged during this
   first "induction" handshake phase.

   If an SRT connection is established over an established and verified
   QUIC connection, the SRT connection time could be reduced to a single
   RTT interval if only the "conclusion" handshaking phase is performed.
   However SRT does not currently provide this functionality, thus
   appropriate modifications are required.

4.4.  Bidirectional Transmission

   Both QUIC and SRT allow bidirectional transmission of a payload over
   a single SRT connection.  Even with a payload sent in one direction,
   some control packets are still sent in the opposite direction over
   the same connection.

4.5.  Congestion Control

   QUIC as a transport mechanism can apply congestion control.  It is
   worth noting, however, the specifics of live streaming compared to
   file-based transmissions.  The payload is not available right away,
   therefore using regular bandwidth probing mechanisms to increase or
   decrease the sending rate would not work.

   The current sending rate is provided by SRT, which in turn receives
   the payload from a live source and can add some overhead when
   retransmission of lost packets is performed.

   However, QUIC can use congestion control to detect congestion and
   throughput bottlenecks, and prevent sending above a certain limit.
   SRT MUST handle such cases by eventually dropping packets, which can
   no longer be recovered.

   It would make sense for a QUIC connection to provide this throughput
   limitation value back to SRT.  In that case SRT could use the number
   to make clever and transport-aware retransmission decisions.

   It is also possible for QUIC to not apply any congestion control,
   relying on SRT.  However, SRT does not reduce the sending rate below
   the input rate.  If the bitrate of the original stream already
   exceeds network throughput, SRT would still try to deliver it,
   maintaining congestion and eventually breaking the SRT connection.

   It is worth mentioning that in a live streaming scenario it may be
   beneficial to move congestion control mechanisms outside of the
   protocol towards the encoder (payload producer), implementing a
   network adaptive encoding based on the telemetry provided by the SRT
   and QUIC protocols.

4.6.  Pacing

   SRT uses ACK/ACKACK packet pairs to measure RTT on a link, and to
   track latency and clock drift.  It also uses packet pair probing to
   estimate connection bandwidth, although in live configurations such
   estimates are informative only.

   Buffering and pacing of SRT packets by QUIC SHOULD be done with the
   understanding that this would interfere with the corresponding SRT
   mechanisms.  Alternatively, SRT may implement a pacer on top of
   QUIC’s congestion control and probing mechanisms to abstract the
   complexity associated with live streaming use cases.

4.7.  Connection Mitigation

   QUIC utilizes Connection UUID to distinguish between connections
   (compared to the IP:Port scheme used by UDP and TCP).  This enables
   already established connections to be handed over seamlessly across
   network interfaces without requiring a new handshake/negotiation.
   SRT may expand on this to enable network bonded delivery workflows to
   switch between optimal transports without a latency hit.

4.8.  Datagram vs H3 Datagram

   As an alternative to using the QUIC Datagram extension, it might be
   possible to consider the H3 Datagram version in order to be
   compatible with more existing load balancers.
